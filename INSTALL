COMPILING
=========

basically:

$ ./configure
$ make

The ./configure script has a couple of optional features that
can be tweaked. For example, uart is currently broken under bochs,
so if you want debug the kernel in bochs (or run it on non intel hardware)
you need to issue:

$ ./configure --disable-uart


INSTALLING
==========

if you have a working "sudo" program and
you can become root, the makefile can mount the floppy image "grub.img"
in loopback with:

$ make loop_mount

otherwise you should mount from root a floppy image in the "grub" subdirectory

# mount -o loop path-to-your-floppy-image grub

or mount a real floppy

# mount /dev/floppy/0 grub

Floppy image files are used primary by the emulators (bochs, vmware)
but they can also be used to boot from network (tftp). I use network boot for
my test machines because floppy are really too slooow.

once the grub disk is mounted either way on the "grub" subdirectory
you can use:

$ make install

which will copy all the kernel files to the disk.
NOTE: you must provide a properly installed grub floppy/image. The makefile
does not install grub on the floppy image. You can use a generic grub floppy,
create your own or use the one provided in the binary distribution of mikuCos.
